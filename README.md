# KotlinCheatSheet

A cheat sheet to help transition from Java/C++ to Kotlin. 

The intent is to create a condensed help sheet to facilitate memory jogging of language feature that differ from Java. This is not a substitute for the excellent "Kotlin in Action" book by Dmitry Jemerov and Svetlana Isakova, or for the comprehesive [Kotlin language](http://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) website.

This sheet uses examples from the Kotlin website https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-web-site
